# Summary

- Try to modify the ONNX model, half way through?

# The current way:

1. Load the ONNX model
2. Build a consumer map for traversal and locate the target deletion node
3. Find all downstream nodes (BFS) and remove them
4. Append last remaining nodeâ€™s output as graph output
	1. The shape is odd, thinking a way how to get the dimension.
5. Save the ONNX Model
